This is a placeholder for the debian packages that are cached when
downloading them from the internet.  If you internet is slow
(like, e.g.: at a conference or seminar), then this folder will be a
godsend for recreating vagrant guest VMs.  It provides a place for the
cached debian packages to live between destroyed and recreated guests.
